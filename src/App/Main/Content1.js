              From childhood, I was fascinated by the diversity and strength of
              emotions that music could provide.
              <br />
              Then I fell in love with radio.
            </p>
            <p>
              I evolved in this environment, surrounded by legends. And I became
              aware of the power of the voice.

              Today, the podcast is a no-brainer. It is sound and meaning, in
              perfect synergy.
